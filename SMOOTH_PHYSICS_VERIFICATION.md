2. ❌ Ball too fast
3. ❌ Ball NEVER slows down on winning number
4. ❌ No visible deceleration

### Solutions Implemented:
1. ✅ Multi-phase animation system with easing
2. ✅ Ball speed reduced from 1.5x to 1.1x wheel speed
3. ✅ 3-second complete rest on winning number
4. ✅ Dramatic visible slowdown with quartic/quintic easing

## 🔧 COMPLETE PHYSICS REWRITE

### New Animation Phases (9.5 seconds total):

#### Phase 1: FAST SPIN (0-3s)
- Wheel and ball spin at relatively constant speed
- Ball rotates opposite direction at 1.1x speed
- Ball gently spirals inward (30% of total inward movement)
- Uses cubic easing for smooth initial motion
- **40% of wheel rotation, 50% of ball rotation**

#### Phase 2: SLOWDOWN (3-5.5s)
- Ball **VISIBLY** slows down dramatically
- Uses **quartic easing** (easeOutQuartic) for dramatic deceleration
- Ball continues spiraling inward (60% of remaining movement)
- **55% of wheel rotation, 45% of ball rotation**
- **USER WILL CLEARLY SEE THE BALL SLOWING DOWN**

#### Phase 3: SETTLING (5.5-6.5s)
- Ball **ultra-slowly** settles into winning pocket
- Uses **quintic easing** (easeOutQuintic) for ultra-smooth final motion
- Ball reaches exact landing position
- **Final 5% of wheel rotation**
- **SMOOTH, GRADUAL SETTLING - NO SUDDEN STOPS**

#### Phase 4: REST (6.5-9.5s)
- Ball is **COMPLETELY STILL** on winning number
- **3 FULL SECONDS** of rest time
- User can clearly see which number won
- No movement whatsoever

#### Phase 5: RESULT OVERLAY (if time permits)
- Shows result text overlay
- Ball hidden during overlay

## 📊 Key Parameter Changes

### Ball Speed: REDUCED
```javascript
// OLD: Ball too fast
const ballInitialVelocity = -wheelInitialVelocity * 1.5; // ❌ 1.5x = TOO FAST

// NEW: Ball reasonable speed
const ballInitialVelocity = -wheelInitialVelocity * 1.1; // ✅ 1.1x = SMOOTH
```

### Wheel Speed: REDUCED
```javascript
// OLD: Wheel too fast
const wheelInitialVelocity = 15 + Math.random() * 5; // ❌ 15-20 rad/s

// NEW: Wheel smoother
const wheelInitialVelocity = 10 + Math.random() * 3; // ✅ 10-13 rad/s
```

### Ball Rotations: REDUCED
```javascript
// OLD: Ball spins too many times
const ballTotalRotations = 15 + Math.random() * 5; // ❌ 15-20 rotations

// NEW: Ball spins less for smoother visual
const ballTotalRotations = 10 + Math.random() * 3; // ✅ 10-13 rotations
```

### Rest Time: INCREASED
```javascript
// OLD: Not enough rest time
const restPhaseTime = 2.5; // ❌ Only 2.5 seconds

// NEW: Full rest time
const restPhaseTime = 3.0; // ✅ 3 full seconds
```

### FPS: INCREASED FOR SMOOTHNESS
```javascript
// OLD: 16 FPS (128 frames at 8s)
fps = 16

// NEW: 18 FPS (171 frames at 9.5s)
fps = 18 // ✅ 12.5% smoother
```

## 🎨 Easing Functions Added

### 1. Cubic Easing (Fast Spin)
```javascript
function easeOutCubic(t) {
  return 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 3);
}
```
- Used for initial smooth motion
- Gentle deceleration curve

### 2. Quartic Easing (Slowdown) ⭐
```javascript
function easeOutQuartic(t) {
  return 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 4);
}
```
- Used for VISIBLE slowdown phase
- **DRAMATIC deceleration curve**
- User clearly sees ball slowing down

### 3. Quintic Easing (Settling) ⭐⭐
```javascript
function easeOutQuintic(t) {
  return 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 5);
}
```
- Used for ultra-smooth settling
- **ULTRA-SMOOTH final motion**
- Ball gently comes to rest

## ✅ TRIPLE-CHECKED ITEMS

### 1. All Variables Defined ✅
- `currentTime` - ✅ Calculated from frame/fps
- `progress` - ✅ Calculated from frame/totalFrames
- `wheelRotation` - ✅ Set in ALL 5 phases
- `ballAngle` - ✅ Set in ALL 5 phases
- `ballRadius` - ✅ Set in ALL 5 phases
- `showBall` - ✅ Set in ALL 5 phases
- `showResult` - ✅ Set in ALL 5 phases

### 2. Phase Timing Correct ✅
```javascript
const fastSpinTime = 3.0;      // ✅ 3 seconds
const slowdownTime = 2.5;      // ✅ 2.5 seconds
const settlingTime = 1.0;      // ✅ 1 second
const restPhaseTime = 3.0;     // ✅ 3 seconds
// Total: 9.5 seconds ✅
```

### 3. Phase Boundaries Correct ✅
```javascript
const fastSpinEnd = 3.0;           // ✅
const slowdownEnd = 5.5;           // ✅ (3.0 + 2.5)
const settlingEnd = 6.5;           // ✅ (5.5 + 1.0)
const restEnd = 9.5;               // ✅ (6.5 + 3.0)
```

### 4. Ball Lands on Correct Number ✅
```javascript
// Settling phase normalizes angle to shortest path
while (angleDiff > Math.PI) angleDiff -= Math.PI * 2;
while (angleDiff < -Math.PI) angleDiff += Math.PI * 2;
ballAngle = ballStartAngle + (angleDiff * easedProgress);

// Rest phase locks to winning position
ballAngle = BALL_LANDING_POSITION; // ✅ Exactly on winning number
```

### 5. No Linter Errors ✅
```bash
✅ No linter errors found
```

### 6. File Size Safe ✅
```
Resolution: 320×320 ✅
FPS: 18 (increased from 16) ✅
Frames: 171 (increased from 128) ✅
Quality: 10 ✅
