# 🎨 Roulette Visual Upgrade - Cinematic Ball Physics & Effects

## 🎯 Overview

Completely revamped the roulette wheel visuals with realistic ball physics, motion blur, and cinematic effects inspired by professional roulette animations. This brings the Discord bot's roulette wheel to the next level of visual quality while maintaining performance targets (<3MB, <2s encode).

---

## ✨ New Features

### 1. **Realistic Ball Physics**

The roulette ball now behaves like a real casino ball:

```
Phase 1 (0-75% of spin):
- Ball starts on OUTER EDGE of wheel (88% of wheel radius)
- Spins FAST counterclockwise (20x speed at start)
- Stays on outer rim throughout fast spinning
- Motion blur trail visible (3 ghost frames)

Phase 2 (75-100% of spin):
- Ball begins to SPIRAL INWARD
- Gradually loses speed
- Moves from outer edge (88%) to landing position (73%)
- Settles into winning pocket smoothly
- Motion blur fades as ball slows

Landing:
- Ball positions itself directly over winning number
- Final 5 frames: ball hidden (settled in pocket)
- Perfect alignment with winning segment
```

### 2. **Motion Blur Trail**

When the ball is moving fast (speed > 0.3):
- **3 trailing ghost images** behind the ball
- Each trail is slightly smaller and more transparent
- Creates realistic motion blur effect
- Fades out as ball slows down

### 3. **Reflective Ball Rendering**

The ball looks like real chrome with:
- **Radial gradient** (white to silver to chrome)
- **Shadow** underneath (offset +3px for depth)
- **Shine highlight** (small white circle top-left)
- **Gray outline** for definition
- **Size:** 10px diameter (professional scale)

### 4. **Pulsing Glow Effects**

Animated glow that pulses throughout the spin:
- **Sin wave animation** (4 complete cycles during spin)
- **Green (#00FF88)** and **Gold (#FFD700)** glow
- Intensity: 0.5 ± 0.5 (pulsing from dim to bright)
- Applied to:
  - Background radial vignette
  - Outer border neon glow
  - Wheel lighting effects

### 5. **Enhanced Background**

Cinematic dark matte background:
- **Radial gradient** from #1a1a1a (center) to #000000 (edges)
- **Animated glow overlay** during spinning
- Creates vignette effect (focus on wheel)
- Professional broadcast quality

### 6. **Improved Outer Border**

Gold border with animated effects:
- **Neon green shadow** (30-50px blur, pulsing)
- **Inner depth shadow** for 3D effect
- **Gradient gold** (dark → bright → dark)
- Adds cinematic polish

### 7. **Quartic Easing**

Upgraded from cubic to **quartic easeOut** for wheel rotation:
```javascript
easeOutQuartic = t => 1 - Math.pow(1 - t, 4)
```
- **Even smoother** deceleration
- More realistic physics
- Mimics real roulette wheel friction

## 📊 Technical Implementation

### New Function: `drawBall()`

Located in `src/roulette/cinematic-wheel.js`:

```javascript
export function drawBall(ctx, centerX, centerY, ballAngle, ballRadius, speed = 1) {
  // 1. Motion blur trail (3 frames when speed > 0.3)
  // 2. Shadow (offset +3px, +3px)
  // 3. Reflective gradient (white → gray → chrome)
  // 4. Gray outline
  // 5. Shine highlight (white circle top-left)
}
```

**Parameters:**
- `ctx` - Canvas 2D context
- `centerX`, `centerY` - Wheel center coordinates
- `ballAngle` - Ball position angle (radians)
- `ballRadius` - Distance from center
- `speed` - Current speed (0-1, affects motion blur)

### Enhanced `renderCinematicFrame()`

New options:
```javascript
{
  showBall: boolean,        // Whether to render the ball
  ballAngle: number,        // Ball angle in radians
  ballRadius: number,       // Ball distance from center
  glowIntensity: number     // Pulsing glow (0-1)
}
```

### Ball Physics Calculation

In `src/roulette/cinematic-animation.js`:

```javascript
// Calculate for each frame
const wheelRadius = (Math.min(width, height) / 2) - 60;
const maxBallRadius = wheelRadius * 0.88;

if (progress < 0.75) {
  // Fast outer edge spinning
  const ballSpeed = 20 * (1 - progress / 0.75);
  ballAngle -= ballSpeed * 0.04 * frame;
  ballRadius = maxBallRadius;
} else {
  // Spiral inward
  const landProgress = (progress - 0.75) / 0.25;
  const landEase = 1 - Math.pow(1 - landProgress, 3);
  ballRadius = maxBallRadius - (maxBallRadius * 0.15 * landEase);
  ballAngle = targetBallAngle; // Lock to winning segment
}
```
