- **Health Monitoring**: Validates cache health status and warnings
- **Concurrent Access**: Tests multiple simultaneous requests
- **Performance**: 1000 cache hits in < 50ms

### 5. Integration Tests ✅
- **Complete Spin Flow**: Physics → Mapping → Rendering → Embeds
- **Multi-Wheel Support**: Tests both European and American wheels
- **Concurrent Requests**: Validates handling of multiple spins
- **Deterministic Behavior**: Ensures consistent results across runs
- **Error Recovery**: Tests partial failure handling
- **Performance**: Complete spin in < 2s, 5 spins in < 5s
